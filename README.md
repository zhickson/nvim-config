# Neovim config

This is my personal Neovim configuration.

Primarily I build WordPress projects, so my config is focussed on PHP development,
linting, formatting, etc.

This config is based on [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)
and takes inspiration from various other Neovim configs I've found online.

TODO: document out the specific features with this config
